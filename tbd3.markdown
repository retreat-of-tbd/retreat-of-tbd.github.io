---

Join us for 3 days and nights of intense connection, play, learning, personal growth ... whatever you make it. (Plus an optional fourth night, to decompress together.)

## == REGISTRATION ==

Registration is closed

## == COST ==

General tickets are $240 for the whole weekend.

We've budgeted for 6 accessible tickets, at $100-$200 each.

Child tickets (16 years and under) are $40 each.

## == SESSIONS ==

Retreat is a container where participants host activities and sessions on whatever they want.

You can share your passions by offering sessions. You can participate in other sessions that interest you. We invite you to come with the intention to learn new things, grow, play, and connect deeply with each other.

Previous retreats have included:
- Movement (e.g. group strength training and naked dance analysis)
- Discussions (e.g. how to experience more joy)
- Connection (e.g. hot tub hot seat)
- Play (e.g. a fabulous fashion show and paper airplanes)
- Sharing (e.g. tea and chocolate)
- And a bunch more (skill shares, singing, improv, personal support ... whatever people bring into the space)

What happens at this retreat is up to you!

## == WHO ==

You + 50-ish others.

Kids of all ages are welcome.

If you've been to a previous Retreat of TBD (March, 2019 or February, 2020) then you are welcome to invite others you think would be a great match for the event.

## == WHEN ==

March 23-27, 2023

Please arrive Thursday night (anytime after 4pm) and plan on being there through Sunday at 4pm.

This will help create a strong container to support us in the work (and play) we're all bringing to the weekend.

After closing circle on Sunday afternoon, you're invited to stay an extra night (until noon on Monday) to decompress together.

## == COVID ==

Every participant (of all ages) must rapid test 4 hours or less before arrival AND Friday/Saturday/Sunday mornings.
If you have any symptoms, please stay home (or go home). We'll prorate refunds, if any are necessary. We will be so sad to miss you, but we want to keep everyone safe.

Masks are optional throughout the weekend.

Attendees to Retreat are required to have up to date covid vaccines, with some mitigated exceptions.

Up to date means you've had a covid shot within the last 6 months, or have had the bivalent booster.

If you have registered: Please send us a picture of your vaccine card indicating that you have received the bivalent booster.

In some specific cases, we are allowing exemptions to the booster requirement for attendees with adverse reactions to the COVID-19 vaccines. If this describes you, email us to discuss a waiver of this requirement. We will probably ask for a higher level of COVID safety precautions before the event to mitigate your higher chance of infection, to include a PCR test prior to your arrival.

We reserve the right to add other covid precautions if the landscape changes in the coming months -- but hopefully we won't have to.

## == VALUES ==

**/// Agency (Law of Personal Mobility)**

Choose your own adventure. We'll use Open Space to schedule sessions, and you get to bring whatever you need/want to the space. In fact, we're co-creating this whole event with you.

**/// Work**

This is a place to come and do your work, with support. It'll be fun too! But we want to explicitly focus on moving ourselves forward.

**/// Body, Mind, Heart**

We want to fully integrate all parts of our selves.

**/// Safer / Stretch Space**

We want everyone to be able to fully participate without fear of being harassed or discriminated against. With a bunch of people trying new things, we acknowledge that people might misstep, and if/when that happens, we offer lots of support.

We're very excited and can't wait to connect/grow/play/learn with you again! ‚ù§
