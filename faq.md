**If I have an ongoing symptom, but have been cleared by a doctor, am I still able to attend?**

If an attendee (of any age) has chronic symptoms prior to Retreat that a doctor has evaluated and declared not contagious, they are welcome to attend. As with all other attendees, if symptoms change/worsen, we are asking that they depart.

**How has the organizing team addressed community feedback in shaping the health and wellness policy for TBD 5?**


We are doing the following to address a variety of concerns and questions brought up by the community:
- **Moving outside the winter months** - we have a May date in hopes of getting more distance from cold and flu season, as well as the part of the year that also carries the highest COVID rates. We also have chosen a venue that allows for a lot more outdoor sessions and play, which hopefully can offer opportunities for those who do choose to mask indoors to be able to engage unmasked if they're comfortable. 
- **Consistent + visible daily testing** - We are addressing the ways in which people were impacted by a lack of follow-through on daily testing by asking for a "Morning Rapid Test Fairy" volunteer. This attendee will hold the responsibility of assuring that attendees have tested prior to joining breakfast or morning news. We hope people will budget the time necessary to test before each day starts by setting this expectation clearly and holding this boundary each day. 
- **Accessibility coordinator** - Blaze will be acting as our Accessibility Coordinator for the event this year to provide a beacon for those who need support or needs addressed prior to and during Retreat. Blaze will also be in contact with registered parents prior to Retreat to coordinate potential avenues of support.
