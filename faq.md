### If I have an ongoing symptom, but have been cleared by a doctor, am I still able to attend?

If an attendee (of any age) has chronic symptoms prior to Retreat that a doctor has evaluated and declared not contagious, they are welcome to attend. As with all other attendees, if symptoms change/worsen, we are asking that they depart.

### How has the organizing team addressed community feedback in shaping the health and wellness policy for TBD 5?


We are doing the following to address a variety of concerns and questions brought up by the community:
- **Moving outside the winter months** - we have a May date in hopes of getting more distance from cold and flu season, as well as the part of the year that also carries the highest COVID rates. We also have chosen a venue that allows for a lot more outdoor sessions and play, which hopefully can offer opportunities for those who do choose to mask indoors to be able to engage unmasked if they're comfortable. 
- **Consistent + visible daily testing** - We are addressing the ways in which people were impacted by a lack of follow-through on daily testing by asking for a "Morning Rapid Test Fairy" volunteer. This attendee will hold the responsibility of assuring that attendees have tested prior to joining breakfast or morning news. We hope people will budget the time necessary to test before each day starts by setting this expectation clearly and holding this boundary each day. 
- **Accessibility coordinator** - Blaze will be acting as our Accessibility Coordinator for the event this year to provide a beacon for those who need support or needs addressed prior to and during Retreat. Blaze will also be in contact with registered parents prior to Retreat to coordinate potential avenues of support.

## How do invites work?

TBD retreats are special in part because of their closed, invite-only model. Events are shared only by word of mouth and within private channels—please don’t publicize them.

**Who can invite?**

- **Alumni (past attendees)**: If you’ve attended a TBD retreat, you can invite others. Invitations must be personal and direct—let your invitee know why you’re excited for them to join. If they accept, help them join our communication channels (e.g., Facebook, Discord). You don’t need to attend their first event.
- **First-time invitees**: If you’ve been invited but haven’t attended yet, and feel called to invite someone into the space - we encourage you to reach out to the person who invited you to see if they are willing to invite and hold space for them.

**Inviter Responsibilities**

Be your invitee’s first point of contact, help them understand what to expect, and guide them through registration.
Participate in an accountability process, if needed, for your invitee at their first event.

**Why this way?**

TBD events thrive on trust and connection. Every attendee is personally invited, creating a safe(r) environment where we can lean into our vulnerability, address our mistakes, and take responsibility for ourselves and each other. We encourage you to invite trustworthy, fun, and values-aligned people, trusting your judgment to maintain the integrity of our community.

### If I'm attending MFC before TBD, should I assume that counts as a COVID exposure?

As MFC is a large, unmasked event that only requires testing upon arrival, it is a higher risk event. **If there are reported COVID cases at MFC in the week following, anyone who attended will be required to take a NAAT or PCR test Friday 5/23 (5 days post event) before joining us at TBD.** If it’s accessible to you, we would recommend taking a NAAT or PCR on Friday regardless of reported cases at the event. 

We will have a few Metrix® COVID-19 NAAT tests available. David has volunteered his Metrix reader, which will be available in Seattle Friday between 10a-1p, or at the venue throughout the weekend. Please reach out to David if you would like to schedule a time to use his reader on Friday.
