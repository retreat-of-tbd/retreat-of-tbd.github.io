# Retreat of TBD Website

## Install locally

```
> bundle
> make
```

That should be it to get things working locally. You can see the site at localhost:4000.

## How does it work?

We use Jekyll to generate this site. Github Pages also uses Jekyll. When you push, github will generate your site and publish it for you to:

```retreat-of-tbd.github.io```
