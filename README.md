# Retreat of TBD Website

## Install locally

```
> bundle
> make
```

That should be it to get things working locally. You can see the site at localhost:4000.

## How does it work?

We use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) to generate this site locally. We host it on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). When you push your changes to github, it also uses Jekyll to generate the site and then publishes it for you to:
