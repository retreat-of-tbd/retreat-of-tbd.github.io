Coming soon!

## = When and where =

**4pm Friday, May 23 - 6pm Monday, May 26 (Memorial Day Weekend)**

*Please arrive Friday evening between 4 p.m. and 7:30 p.m., and plan on being there through the closing circle on Monday at 4 p.m. This will help us create a strong container to support us in the work (and play) we're all bringing to the weekend.*

## = Who =

You + 50-ish other adults (kids are welcome)

If you've been to a previous Retreat of TBD, then you are welcome to invite others you think would be a great fit for the event. Please make sure to consider our [DEI initiative](#-diversity-equity--inclusion-dei-initiative-) when inviting people into our space.

## = Diversity, equity & inclusion (DEI) initiative =

While we have worked to build a more welcoming and safe space with our retreats, the reality is that TBD is still not entirely welcoming to or representative of all people. As organizing and participating members of the TBD community, we have the agency to shape our retreats towards greater diversity, equity, and inclusion by challenging how we retreat. 

For TBD 2025, the organizing team is actively working towards and prioritizing building a more inclusive environment with the following actions:

TBD will be holding ten of the fifty available tickets for BIPOC attendees who have not attended a Retreat of TBD before. These tickets will become available upon our first wave of registration, and will be held until two months prior to the event (March 23) at which point they will be released to waitlisted registrants. 

We are asking you, our TBD alumni, to expand on who you invite into our retreat space. 

We will be making intentional choices to make the retreat more inclusive as a part of this initiative.

## = Sharing space in a multi generational community =
As TBD has grown, so has the age range of our attendees, including families with kids, and we think that’s really cool! In an effort to make this space feel comfortable, relaxing, and worthwhile to everyone, we have made some intentional choices for this Retreat in response to feedback from our alumni to create spaces that allow different experiences.

Sharing space with lots of people across sensory needs and age ranges can be both gratifying and challenging at times. We have made some choices for this Retreat in response to feedback to create spaces to help.

Indoors, we will be holding a few lower-stimulation, adult-only, and sound-enthusiastic spaces throughout the venue.
- The basement level will be an adult-only space throughout the weekend for sleeping, socializing, and daytime sessions. 
- The passthrough kitchen will be our sound-enthusiastic indoor space throughout the day while sessions are happening in the main room, upper floor, and basement. 
- All other common spaces will be used for sessions throughout the day, and we’re asking for courtesy and respect for those spaces while passing through. 

Retreat is also happening in May this year in hopes that spring will bring warmer weather and more comfortable access to the outdoors. The Big House Lodge offers 8 acres of luscious land for outdoor sessions, exploring, and playing.


## = Sessions =

Retreat is a container where participants host activities and sessions on whatever they want. You can share your passions by offering sessions. You can participate in other sessions that interest you. We invite you to come with the intention to learn new things, grow, play, and connect deeply with each other.

What sessions will be offered? It depends on who comes.

Previous retreats have included:

- Movement (e.g. contact improv, group strength training, naked dance analysis)
- Discussions (e.g. comparing relationship check-in formats, your relationship to anger)
- Connection (e.g. hot tub hot seat, 3 minute tantric)
- Breaking through barriers (e.g. UX-designing your life, build an official will)
- Play (e.g. fruit ninja, paper airplanes, a fabulous fashion show, sardines hide and seek, pillow fight)
- Sharing (e.g. tea and chocolate, sensation tastings, magic show for adults)
- Skills Share (e.g. lock picking, celtic rope knots) 
- And a bunch more (singing, improv, personal support ... whatever people were passionate enough to bring into the space)

What happens at this retreat is up to you!
