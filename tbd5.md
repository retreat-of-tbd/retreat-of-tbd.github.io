## = Who =

You + 50-ish others (kids are welcome)

If you've been to a previous Retreat of TBD, then you are welcome to invite others you think would be a great fit for the event. Please make sure to consider our [DEI initiative](#-diversity-equity--inclusion-dei-initiative-) when inviting people into our space.

## = When =

**4pm Friday, May 23 - 6pm Monday, May 26 (Memorial Day Weekend)**

Please arrive Friday evening between 4 p.m. and 7:30 p.m., and plan on being there through the closing circle on Monday at 4 p.m. This will help us create a strong container to support us in the work (and play) we're all bringing to the weekend.

After closing circle on Monday afternoon, you're invited to stay an extra night (until 11 a.m. on Tuesday) to decompress together.

## = Diversity, equity & inclusion (DEI) initiative =

While we have worked to build a more welcoming and safe space with our retreats, the reality is that TBD is still not entirely welcoming to or representative of all people. As organizing and participating members of the TBD community, we have the agency to shape our retreats towards greater diversity, equity, and inclusion by challenging how we retreat. 

For TBD 2025, the organizing team is actively working towards and prioritizing building a more inclusive environment with the following actions:

TBD will be holding ten of the fifty available tickets for BIPOC attendees who have not attended a Retreat of TBD before. These tickets will become available upon our first wave of registration, and will be held until two months prior to the event (March 23) at which point they will be released to waitlisted registrants. 

We are asking you, our TBD alumni, to expand on who you invite into our retreat space. 

We will be making intentional choices to make the retreat more inclusive as a part of this initiative.

## = Host team =

This is the core team that finds the venue, sends out the invitations, and helps set the stage so that you can fill it with your magic.
