TBD is back! Three days and nights of intense connection, play, personal growth ... and/or whatever you want it to be. Offer sessions on whatever you like, and participate in other sessions that interest you.

If you've been to a previous Retreat of TBD (March, 2019, February, 2020, or March 2023) you are welcome to invite others you think would be a great match for the event.


## == THEME ==

Our theme is: Imbolc: How will you ready your garden for the seeds you want to plant?

Imbolc (Feb 1st) is the point halfway between Winter Solstice and Spring Equinox. In pagan Celtic tradition, it was celebrated as the beginning of Spring. Traditional activities included Spring cleaning, preparing the garden to plant, and having bonfires. Brigid, the Celtic goddess of fire and fertility was often invoked and celebrated on this day.

This retreat, we will invite you to consider questions like:
- What do you need to be ready for upcoming dreams, projects and ideas?
- What resources need to be replenished?
- Who do you need to prep to be on your team?
- What intentions do you want to grow?
- With whom do you want to be dreaming?
- Where do you want your dreams to take root?


## == WHEN ==

4pm Thursday, February 22 - 6pm Sunday, February 25

Please arrive Thursday evening (anytime after 4pm and before 7:30pm) and plan on being there through closing circle on Sunday at 4pm. This will help us create a strong container to support us in the work (and play) we're all bringing to the weekend.

After closing circle on Sunday afternoon, you're invited to stay an extra night (until noon on Monday) to decompress together.


## == COST ==

General tickets are $360 for the whole weekend.

We've budgeted for 5 accessible tickets, at $200-$300 each.

Child tickets (16 years and under) are $120 each.


## == SESSIONS ==

Retreat is a container where participants host activities and sessions on whatever they want. You can share your passions by offering sessions. You can participate in other sessions that interest you. We invite you to come with the intention to learn new things, grow, play, and connect deeply with each other.

What sessions will be offered? It depends on who comes.

Previous retreats have included:
- Movement (e.g. contact improv, group strength training, naked dance analysis)
- Discussions (e.g. comparing relationship check-in formats, group strength training)
- Connection (e.g. hot tub hot seat)
- Breaking through barriers (e.g. UX-designing your life)
- Play (e.g. fruit ninja, paper airplanes, a fabulous fashion show)
- Sharing (e.g. tea and chocolate)
- And a bunch more (skill shares, singing, improv, personal support ... whatever people were passionate enough to bring into the space)

What happens at this retreat is up to you!

## == WHO ==

You + 30-ish others.

Kids of all ages are welcome.

If you've been to a previous Retreat of TBD (March, 2019, February, 2020 or March 2023) then you are welcome to invite others you think would be a great fit for the event.

## == COVID ==

-Every participant (of all ages) must rapid test Tuesday (2 days before the event) AND 4 hours or less before arrival AND Friday/Saturday/Sunday mornings.
-If you have any symptoms, please stay home (or go home). We'll prorate refunds if any are necessary. We will be so sad to miss you, but we want to keep everyone safe.
â€“Masks are optional throughout the weekend.
-Attendees to Retreat are required to have up-to-date COVID-19 vaccines, with some mitigated exceptions.
-"Up-to-date" means you've had a covid shot within the last 6 months, or have had the most recent vaccine.
-If you have registered: Please send us a picture of your vaccine card.
-In some specific cases, we are allowing exemptions to the booster requirement for attendees with adverse reactions to the COVID-19 vaccines. If this describes you, email us to discuss a waiver of this requirement. We will probably ask for a higher level of COVID-19 safety precautions before the event to mitigate your higher chance of infection, including a PCR test prior to your arrival.
-EXPOSURE PROTOCOLS
-TESTING PROTOCOLS FOR KIDS - CLARIFY
-We reserve the right to add other COVID precautions if the landscape changes in the coming months -- but hopefully we won't have to.


## == VALUES ==

**-- Agency (Law of Personal Mobility) --**

Choose your own adventure. We'll use Open Space to schedule sessions, and you get to bring whatever you need/want to the space. In fact, we're co-creating this whole event with you.

**-- Work --**

This is a place to come and do your work, with support. It'll be fun too! But we want to explicitly focus on moving ourselves forward.

**-- Body, Mind, Heart --**

We want to fully integrate all parts of our selves.

**-- Safer / Stretch Space --**

We want everyone to be able to fully participate without fear of being harassed or discriminated against. With a bunch of people trying new things, we acknowledge that people might misstep, and if/when that happens, we offer (and encourage other attendees to offer) support.

We're very excited, and can't wait to connect/grow/play with you again!
