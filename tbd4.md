Our theme was: Imbolc: How will you ready your garden for the seeds you want to plant?

Imbolc (Feb 1st) is the point halfway between Winter Solstice and Spring Equinox. In pagan Celtic tradition, it was celebrated as the beginning of Spring. Traditional activities included Spring cleaning, preparing the garden to plant, and having bonfires. Brigid, the Celtic goddess of fire and fertility was often invoked and celebrated on this day.

This retreat, we invited you to consider questions like:
- What do you need to be ready for upcoming dreams, projects and ideas?
- What resources need to be replenished?
- Who do you need to prep to be on your team?
- What intentions do you want to grow?
- With whom do you want to be dreaming?
- Where do you want your dreams to take root?
