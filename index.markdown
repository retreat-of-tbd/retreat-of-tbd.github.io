The Retreat of TBD is 3 days and nights of intense connection, play, personal growth ... and/or whatever you want it to be. Offer sessions on whatever you like, and participate in other sessions that interest you.

What sessions will be offered? Depends on who comes. It's probably safe to say they will include things on movement, communication, breaking through barriers, playing, singing, and really anything anyone is passionate enough to bring into the space. They can be a skill share (e.g. Learn to slackline), a discussion (Let's talk about gender in my community), a question (How can I better show up for my partner?), or even a space (Let's sit around the fire and draw). Up to you!

# Our Values

## Agency (Law of Personal Mobility)

Choose your own adventure. We'll use Open Space to schedule sessions, and you get to bring whatever you need/want to the space. In fact, we're co-creating this whole event with you.
 
## Work

This is a place to come and do your work, with support. It'll be fun too! But we want to explicitly focus on moving ourselves forward.
 
## Body, Mind, & Heart

We want to create a space that invites all parts of ourselves to show up. Bring your whole self.
 
## Safer / Stretch Space

We want everyone to be able to fully participate without fear of being harassed or discriminated against. With a bunch of people trying new things, we acknowledge that people might misstep, and if/when that happens, we offer (and encourage other attendees to offer) support.


# Health Policy

Every participant (of all ages) must rapid test Tuesday (2 days before the event) AND 4 hours or less before arrival AND Friday/Saturday/Sunday mornings.

If you have any symptoms, please stay home (or go home). We'll prorate refunds if any are necessary. We will be so sad to miss you, but we want to keep everyone safe.

Masks are optional throughout the weekend.

Attendees to Retreat are required to have up-to-date COVID-19 vaccines, with some mitigated exceptions.

"Up-to-date" means you've had a covid shot within the last 6 months, or have had the most recent vaccine.

In some specific cases, we are allowing exemptions to the booster requirement for attendees with adverse reactions to the COVID-19 vaccines. If this describes you, email us to discuss a waiver of this requirement. We will probably ask for a higher level of COVID-19 safety precautions before the event to mitigate your higher chance of infection, including a PCR test prior to your arrival.

We reserve the right to add other COVID precautions if the landscape changes in the coming months -- but hopefully we won't have to.

During the event: 
- if symptoms come up, then mask + inform host on duty + test if its been more than 6h since last rapid test
- if you have a fever, strong or worsening symptoms, or a postive test, then isolate, and go home
