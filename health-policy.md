Every participant (of all ages) must rapid test Tuesday (2 days before the event) AND 4 hours or less before arrival AND Friday/Saturday/Sunday mornings.

If you have any symptoms, please stay home (or go home). We'll prorate refunds if any are necessary. We will be so sad to miss you, but we want to keep everyone safe.

Masks are optional throughout the weekend.

Attendees to Retreat are required to have up-to-date COVID-19 vaccines, with some mitigated exceptions.

"Up-to-date" means you've had a covid shot within the last 6 months, or have had the most recent vaccine.

In some specific cases, we are allowing exemptions to the booster requirement for attendees with adverse reactions to the COVID-19 vaccines. If this describes you, email us to discuss a waiver of this requirement. We will probably ask for a higher level of COVID-19 safety precautions before the event to mitigate your higher chance of infection, including a PCR test prior to your arrival.

We reserve the right to add other COVID precautions if the landscape changes in the coming months -- but hopefully we won't have to.

During the event: 
- if symptoms come up, then mask + inform host on duty + test if its been more than 6h since last rapid test
- if you have a fever, strong or worsening symptoms, or a postive test, then isolate, and go home
