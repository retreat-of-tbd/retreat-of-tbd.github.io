**Attendees of Retreat are required to have up-to-date COVID-19 vaccines.**

In some specific cases, we are allowing exemptions to the booster requirement for attendees with adverse reactions to the COVID-19 vaccines. If this describes you, email us to discuss a waiver of this requirement. We will ask for a higher level of COVID-19 safety precautions before the event to mitigate your potential higher chance of infection.

**In the week before Retreat:** 

- Please be cautious of exposure in large, unmasked, indoor gatherings. 

- Attendees of all ages must rapid test on Wednesday and Friday. Throat swabbing is highly recommended. Test any time on Wednesday, and within 4 hours of arrival on  Friday. 

*If you have a significant COVID exposure the week of Retreat, we will require a negative NAAT or PCR test prior to your arrival, and ask that you wait until 5 days post-exposure to test.*

**If you have ongoing COVID, cold, flu, or RSV symptoms before Retreat** - please stay home this year; we'll provide a full refund. 

When assessing your personal health, please take into account that many attendees feel more comfortable coming to Retreat because of our health and wellness policy. If your body is communicating something out of the ordinary, whether you might be coming down with or still recovering from a cold or something else (sneezing, runny nose, sore throat, swollen lymph nodes, cough, fever), please make decisions that care for your friends and community members.

During retreat, rapid tests will be provided for daily testing - and all attendees are required to test every morning before joining group activities (breakfast/morning news). There will be a sheet in the main space where you can check off that you have tested that morning. 

If you develop symptoms during Retreat - please immediately mask, inform the host on duty and test if it's been more than 6h since your last rapid test. If you have a fever, strong or worsening symptoms, or a positive test, then isolate, and go home. We’ll prorate refunds on request. 

We reserve the right to add other Health and COVID precautions if the landscape changes in the coming months – but hopefully we won’t have to.
